### Parametric Statistics
Parametric statistics is a branch of statistics which assumes that sample data comes from a population that can be adequately modeled by a probability distribution that has a fixed set of parameters.

#### Assumptions of Two-Samples T-test:
- We have two samples of independent observations from two distinct populations
- The samples are independent
- Both populations are normally distributed with unknown mean and standard deviation 
- The standard deviations are equal

#### Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression Model:

- Independent observation
- Normally distribution
- Equal variances
- No influential outliers
- Linear association between (mean) y and x. That is, residual : ri = yi - yhat i.
